# Dribbble

Dribbble is a Craft CMS plugin that enables use of the Dribbble API to pull in shots, users, buckets etc via Twig.

## Install

- Add the `dribbble` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory.
- Navigate to `Settings -> Plugins` and click the "Install" button.
- Register your application with Dribbble Developer - http://developer.dribbble.com.
- Once you've registered your application, copy the `Client Access Token`.
- Navigation to `Settings -> Plugins` and click on settings for Dribbble (Little cog Icon)
- Paste your `Client Access Token` in to `Access Token` field, and save.
 
## Templating

There is only one available Twig tag to pull through anything from the Dribbble API.

The `get` tag allows you to pull anything from the Dribbble API. For example, if you want to output a list of shots by the authorised user, you would do the following:

```HTML
{% for shot in craft.dribbble.get('user/shots', 10) %}
	{{ shot.images.normal }}
{% endfor %}
```

The property/values the `get` method outputs depends on the option you specify. The property/values for the above example can be found under `Shots` (http://developer.dribbble.com/v1/users/shots)

## Options 

<table>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>Name</strong></td>
		<td><strong>Type</strong></td>
		<td><strong>Default Value</strong></td>
		<td><strong>Description</strong></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>GET</td>
		<td>string</td>
		<td>null</td>
		<td>You can use any GET option from the Dribbble API (http://developer.dribbble.com/v1/) e.g. `buckets/madebymayo` or `users/madebymayo/shots`. Also check to see what property/values are output for each GET option</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Limit</td>
		<td>integer</td>
		<td>null</td>
		<td>Sets the limit on the amount of objects pulled from the API</td>
	</tr>
</table>
